# Exercise 5: Accessing and Processing SQL Data

**Objective:**  
Perform a total cost of ownership analysis for vehicles by integrating database access and data processing.

**Topics Covered:**  
- Advanced embedded SQL in Cobol  
- Executing SQL queries that join multiple tables (e.g., vehicle details, costs, and usage data)  
- Parsing and processing SQL query results in Cobol

**Task:**  
1. Write a Cobol program that connects to a MariaDB database.  
2. Execute a query to retrieve vehicle cost-related data.  
3. Process the retrieved data to calculate the total cost of ownership for each vehicle.  
4. Output the results in a formatted report.
