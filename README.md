# Cobol Study Project

This project is designed to introduce basic Cobol programming concepts through a series of exercises. The end goal is to develop an application capable of accessing a SQL database (MariaDB), executing a SQL query, and processing the results into a meaningful output.

## Project Goal

The main application will perform a total cost of ownership analysis for vehicles. It will connect to a MariaDB database containing tables about different types of vehicle costs and usage. The Cobol application will then query this data and calculate the total cost of ownership for each vehicle.

## Exercises

1.  **Hello Cobol**: Introduction to basic Cobol program structure and display statements.
2.  **Variables and Data Types**: Learn to define and manipulate numeric and alphanumeric variables.
3.  **Control Structures & File I/O**: Implement decision logic, loops, and file operations.
4.  **Introduction to Embedded SQL**: Prepare for database integration by connecting to a MariaDB database and running simple SQL queries.
5.  **Accessing and Processing SQL Data**: Develop the final application to perform vehicle cost analysis by executing SQL queries and processing the data.
